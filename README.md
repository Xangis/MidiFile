# MidiFile

An implementation of a MIDI file and helper classes related to recording and playback.

It is written using C++ from scratch and has no additional dependencies.

It is used by some of the applications at https://github.com/Xangis
for sound playback, particularly the MidiPlayer application here:

https://github.com/Xangis/MIDIPlayer

It is released under the terms of the MIT license.

# Building

On Windows, use the Visual Studio project to build the library. Link the MidiFile.lib
file with your project.

On Linux, most projects usually just compile in the source files that they need.

# Development Status

I actively maintain this library because MidiPlayer depends on it.
